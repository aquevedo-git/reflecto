Daily state reflection:
energy: {energy}
mood: {mood}
stress: {stress}
focus: {focus}
confidence: {confidence}

These states subtly influence Reflecto’s facial expression, posture, and gaze. High energy may show in alert eyes and upright posture; low energy in softer features. Mood and stress are visible in micro-expressions. Focus and confidence affect the steadiness of the gaze and the openness of body language. All changes are realistic and nuanced, never exaggerated.
